# 💰 Susu Box

**Susu Box** is a digital **Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA)** platform designed to help individuals save money collectively in a universal account and withdraw funds on a rotational basis.  

The platform leverages automation and secure digital systems to eliminate the common challenges of traditional group savings schemes, ensuring transparency, security, and fairness for all participants.

## 🔒 How It Works

1. **Group Creation** – Users create or join a Susu group with defined rotation and payment terms.  
2. **Contribution Phase** – Members deposit their agreed savings into a collective digital account.  
3. **Automated Disbursement** – Funds are automatically released to members according to the rotation schedule.  
4. **Reserve Fund** – A small percentage of payouts is held in a reserve to cushion contributors against defaults or member withdrawals.  
5. **Completion** – After all rotations, the held reserve funds are fully distributed to contributors.
